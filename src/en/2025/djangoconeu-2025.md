Dublin's reputation precedes it: live music, a welcoming people and spirited environment.
A city of ornate Georgian architecture bisected by canals. At the end of April 2025 three
hundred members of the global Django community shut ourselves away from all this in a
hotel in Dublin's suburbs and kicked off that year's DjangoCon EU! This is a synopsis of
my time there.

<h2 class="mt-5">Day 0</h2>

The soundtrack to today's breakfast was, as on many days, an episode of the Django
Chat podcast. The airport setting, however, was less routine - I was on my way to
DjangoCon Europe!

I am delighted to be representing the University of Cambridge's DevOps division at this
year's conference, and look forward to talks reinforcing Django fundamentals or exploring
the future of the framework and its community. A framework that is at the core of the work
carried out by DevOps @ Cambridge.

The flight was spent picking up tips from Adam Johnson's 'Speed Up Your Django Tests'
(browse his catalogue of invaluable e-books at <a href="https://adamchainz.gumroad.com" target="_blank">https://adamchainz.gumroad.com</a>)
and poring over the conference schedule. I am excited to meet people I otherwise only
know through the Internet. Carlton Gibson & Will Vincent, hosts of the aforementioned
Django Chat (<a href="https://djangochat.com/" target="_blank">https://djangochat.com</a>)
have talks, as does Sarah Boyce, the latest Django Fellow.

Stay tuned for digests from the next few days of talks - from Data-Oriented Design,
workshops on measuring quality in Software Engineering, or a Q&A with Django's board.

<h2 class="mt-5">Day 1</h2>

A brilliant Day 1 of DjangoCon Europe! The day included:

- Sarah Boyce's keynote on contributing to Django, and how attention is a vital resource
in open-source projects.
- Jacob Rief's top tips on using Playwright as a less-flaky alternative to Selenium.
- Tim Bell's masterclass on migrating data fields at scale at Kraken.
- Adam Johnson's talk on Data-Oriented Django and how to speed up database queries.
- Daniele Procida (creator of DiÃ¡taxis) on how to define, measure and elevate quality at
scale.

And a shout-out to the MercadonaIT delegation who took the time to chat about the tech
landscape in Spain, with an emphasis on Django & Python.

As lovely as it was to learn so much and meet new people on the hallway track, the day's
best moment came courtesy of an old colleague. It was a pleasant surprise to bump into
Harinder Toor, a talented Python engineer who got their start as I did as a graduate dev
at Nomensa.

It seems unlikely that Day 2 can surpass this, but the roster of speakers is promising
indeed!

<h2 class="mt-5">Day 2</h2>

My Day 2 of DjangoCon Europe had two distinct yet complementary flavours: a focus on
community & technical deep-dives.

The collaboration enabled by open-source transcends geographical & cultural barriers, yet
it is in-person in Dublin that I see the people behind Django at their best.

At the annual meeting of members of the Django Software Foundation it was enlightening to
hear concerns & suggestions regarding the framework's trajectory.

- Emma Dellescolle's introduction to the Steering Council for the 6.x release cycle pulled
  back the curtain on the project's governance and keeping decision-making nimble.
- Carlton Gibson had the best take on 'consensus' I've heard - one of building trust.
  Framing Django as "a community first, a web framework second" cemented why it is one of
  the best tools to build with.

The technical deep-dives I attended were excellent, and left me eager to share insights
with colleagues:

- Haki Benita's lively tour of best practices for foreign keys & indexes, with plenty of
  actionable advice for writing robust migrations.
- Jacob Walls' talk on dynamic models threatened to go completely over my head, but he
  made the subject accessible and pragmatic.
- Tom Carrick brought securing the Django Admin into the 21st century with his demo of
  adding passkeys to an app, sharing many lessons from doing so.

<h2 class="mt-5">Day 3 &amp; sprints</h2>

The conference brings to mind a particle accelerator: countless disciplines
(accessibility, DevX, core team, security, documentation, third-party packages...)
whizzing past each other, their collisions resulting in bursts of energetic conversation
& collaboration!

Day 3 talks included:

- Will Vincent from JetBrains showed us how to deploy machine learning models using
  everyone's favourite web framework.
- Karen Jex from Crunchy Data shone a light on the dark recesses of database queries
  otherwise abstracted away by the ORM.
- Graham Knapp &ndash; co-maintainer of `django-waffle` &ndash; explained how feature
  flags accelerate getting changes to users.
- Thomas De Bonnet showed how to improve performance and UX via the judicious application
  of HTMX. An opportune talk given the buzz around HTMX in the Django community both
  online and in-person!
- AgnÃ¨s Haasser spoke on the importance of adding Multi-Factor Authentication, and how
  this can be done with relative ease. (and taught us a couple new words in French!)

Despite the name, attendees weren't limited to Europe. It was wonderful to also meet
delegates from Latin America, the United States, the Middle East, Africa, India, and
Australia.

While I didnâ€™t get as stuck in contributing to Django during the 'sprints' as I'd hoped,
the conversations and hands-on work with `nox` & matrix strategies for test automation
will yield dividends in other open source work I hope to share in coming weeks.

With thanks to everyone who welcomed me to the community, to the organisers for ensuring
it all ran smoothly (heroes!), and to my employer for making attending possible.
